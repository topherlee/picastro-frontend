15 User Manual and Maintenance of the Application (Mohtalifa)
In this chapter, we will discuss the user manual and maintenance of our app. We have provided a README.md file on GitHub that explains the required steps to properly run the frontend and backend server on a local machine.
15.1 User Manual for an Admin User
In the Django framework, the admin panel is one of the most amazing features we use as the default interface for administrators. A trusted administrator may manage content on an application using a perfect interface that is model-based once it receives information from the app's models. To maintain our app, we created a superuser for the admin panel so that admin can login.

After the super user inputs the credentials (admin username = "admin" and password = "picastro") into the admin login screen, the admin has access to control the app's contents for various models. This admin panel is only accessible to the admin user.



15.2 User Manual for an App User
Our app is a kind of social media app (astrophotography image-sharing application). Our app name is “Picastro.” Where users can share their pictures and Bio. Users can see another user’s post. But Every user must be registered otherwise they can’t use this app. Every registered user can access the app. After that, they can see the app’s home feed where users can post pictures. Each user will have a profile. As usual, users can edit their profiles. They can react to other users to post with a star. Users can get ranked with three types of trophies (Gold, Silver, and Bronze). 
15.3 Maintenance Manual – Installation Requirements and Procedure to Run the App Backend:
Backend: For our mobile app backend, we used Django for our backend API. That means we took the data from our database and will serve it in an adjacent format to our frontend. Our team used the Django rest framework which is another library on top of Django. Django Rest framework helped us build our API. The combination of Django and Django Rest framework is so powerful. However, we have a GitHub repository for the backend which is necessary to clone the code onto a local machine for maintenance purposes. After cloning our local machine, we need to install some packages to run the app backend. In this GitHub (https://github.com/UoA-CS551R/Team-Bravo-2023-backend.git), there is a README.md file that gave instructions for package installation. If anyone follows our README.md file, they can easily understand Installation Requirements and Procedures to Run the App Backend. But most important one command, you can install all requirements at once with the command pip install -r requirements.txt. 
Frontend: Our team members used react-native for mobile applications. It’s the version of react. Building a mobile app, we wrote JavaScript, and it compiled into react. When we will start working with react then we will be able to see our application running on your mobile device or in an emulator. But, First, we should set up all dependencies. We need to use this link ( How to Set Up React Native Environment) to set up the app environment. For the frontend, we have also another GitHub repository (https://github.com/UoA-CS551R/Team-Bravo-2023.git). There is a README.md file that helps us install all requirements. In this file, our team members describe both android and iOS building and running applications.
