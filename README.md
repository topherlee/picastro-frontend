## Vision
 Add something about what the application will do when more complete


## Requirements
In order to run the app in an emulator on your local machine, you need to follow the instructions on https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.

All libraries needed to build this application can be found in package.json. In order to install them, run `npm install` or `yarn install`, depending on the package manager you are using.


## Testing the build
How do I test the code to ensure the build is correct?


## Building and Running the Application
 
### For iOS Development
After cloning/pulling the source code onto your local machine, `cd` into the project folder, then run `cd ios` to change to the ios folder, afterwards run `pod install` to install all dependencies. The next step is to execute the command `npx react-native run-ios`.

### For Android Development
After cloning/pulling the source code onto your local machine, `cd` into the project folder, then run `npm install` to install all dependencies. In order to start the emulator, run the command `npx react-native start`, and after the emulator has been started completely, run `npx react-native run-android`.
